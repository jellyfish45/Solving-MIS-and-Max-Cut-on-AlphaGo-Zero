# Solving NP-Hard Problems on Graphs with Extended AlphaGo Zero
Python implementation of the above paper for *MaximumIndependentSet*.

Note that this is an old version.
The latest results in the paper were generated by [C++ implementation](https://github.com/xuzijian629/combopt-zero).

## Getting Started
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Directory Structure
- environ: graph environment (MDP)
- gcn: graph convolutional netoworks model
- gin: graph isomophism networks model
- policy: policy gradient method (REINFORCE)
- trainer: train with REINFORCE
- mcts: Monte Carlo Tree Search
- utils: utils
